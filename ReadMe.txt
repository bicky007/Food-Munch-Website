Hello everyone,

I have created this website using just HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and you can also create it in a very easy way which looks very beautiful and attractive.


Details about the website

There is a navigation bar at the top of the website, by clicking on which you can go to that specific section and if you click on the logo of the food platform, you will be redirected to the home page. The two buttons (View Menu and Order Now) given on the home page are not active yet. If you want to give it action, then you can create two separate sections for it and get it redirected. And then when you scroll through the website. If you go down then there you can see how different views have been created for all the sections.

Note: This website is fully responsive, if you open it on your mobile phone also, you will not see any overlap.



For Use the webaite simply download the code/file and create a folder and add the downloaded file in that folder and open your folder with Vs code and run the project and you will be able to view the output.
